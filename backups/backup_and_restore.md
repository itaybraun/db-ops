# Database Backup and Restore
## The Importance of Backups in Database Management
Backups are a critical component of any database management strategy, ensuring data safety and continuity in case of failures, corruption, or accidental deletions. They provide a safety net, allowing recovery to a known good state and minimizing data loss.

Effective backup planning requires a thorough understanding of two key factors:

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: How long it takes to restore the database from a backup. This determines the duration the database will be down during a recovery process.
2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: These are agreements on acceptable levels of downtime and data loss. SLOs help in setting expectations and determining the backup strategy that balances recovery speed and resource utilization.

By aligning backup strategies with RTO and SLO considerations, organizations can ensure they meet their operational requirements and maintain data availability and integrity.


## Backup Types
There are three fundamentally different approaches to backing up PostgreSQL data:

SQL dump

File system level backup

Continuous archiving

Each has its own strengths and weaknesses;

## Limitations of AWS RDS Backups

While AWS RDS provides automated backups and snapshots, they may not be sufficient for all scenarios. These backups have certain limitations, such as potential delays in restoring large databases, lack of granularity in point-in-time recovery, and dependency on AWS infrastructure. For comprehensive data protection, it's often necessary to implement additional backup strategies tailored to specific business needs.
