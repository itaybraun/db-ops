# Connection Pooler for PostgreSQL

A connection pooler for PostgreSQL is a software component that manages a pool of pre-established database connections. Instead of creating a new connection for every request, the pooler efficiently reuses existing connections from the pool, significantly reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.

## Benefits

By reusing connections, a connection pooler can improve the performance and scalability of applications that interact with PostgreSQL databases, especially in scenarios with high concurrency or frequent database interactions. It does this by:

1. Avoiding the overhead of creating new connections for each request.
2. Implementing optimizations like connection validation, timeout management, and load balancing.
3. Enforcing limits on the maximum number of connections to prevent resource exhaustion.

- PgBouncer
- pgpool-II
- [Odyssey](https://github.com/yandex/odyssey)
- [Amazon RDS Proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/) 
- Language-specific libraries like:
   - `node-postgres-pool` for Node.js

   - `django-pool` for Python Django

Tip - If you're using AWS then use the AWS RDS SQL Proxy. 
Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, 
exhausting database memory and compute resources. 
Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. With RDS Proxy, 
failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66% and database credentials, authentication, and access can be managed through integration with AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
