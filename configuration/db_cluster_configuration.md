# AWS RDS Configuration

The main considerations when configuring an RDS.

## The Flow

- **Configure an RDS**: Specify the name, location, and instance type (CPU, Memory, IO) to suit your workload.
- **Configure Network**: Proper network configuration is crucial as direct connections to the RDS are not possible without appropriate settings.
- **Configure the PostgreSQL Server**: Fine-tune PostgreSQL settings to optimize performance and stability.
- **Configure Monitoring**: Utilize CloudWatch and SQL Performance Insights to monitor database performance and gain insights into query efficiency and resource usage.
- **Configure Logging**: Implement logging to track database activities and troubleshoot issues effectively.
- **Advanced (Optional) Configuration**: Take advantage of AWS-specific features like DevOps Guru and Change Log for enhanced management and operational capabilities.
