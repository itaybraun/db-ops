## Essential PostgreSQL Extensions for Database Operations

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system that supports a wide variety of features and extensions. Using extensions in PostgreSQL can significantly enhance its functionality, providing advanced capabilities without the need for custom development. It's important to have some essential extensions installed and ready for use, as they can improve performance, enhance security, and simplify database management.

### Extensions with some impact on Performance

These extensions have a minimal impact on performance, but it is still recommended to use them:  

[pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html)
- **Purpose**: Tracks execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by the server.
- **Usage**: Helps in identifying slow queries and optimizing database performance.
- **Impact**: Minimal

[pg_buffercache](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbuffercache.html)
- **Purpose**: Provides a means to examine what's currently loaded in the PostgreSQL buffer cache.
- **Usage**: Helps in analyzing buffer cache usage, understanding which tables and indexes are frequently accessed, and identifying potential performance bottlenecks related to cache efficiency.
- **Impact**: Minimal. It only retrieves information about the current state of the buffer cache without making significant changes to the database operation.


### Extensions with no impact on Performance
These extensions do not consume any significant resources when installed and can be considered a no-brainer to have in your PostgreSQL setup:
**amcheck**
- **Purpose**: Provides functions to verify the logical consistency of indexes.
- **Usage**: Useful for detecting and diagnosing index corruption issues, ensuring the integrity of database indexes.
- **Impact**: No impact on performance except when actively running consistency checks. The checks themselves are resource-intensive but only when executed.

**hypo_pg**
- **Purpose**: Allows creation of hypothetical indexes that do not physically exist in the database.
- **Usage**: Helps in query planning and performance testing by allowing DBAs to see how different indexes might affect query performance without actually creating them.
- **Impact**: No impact on performance except when evaluating hypothetical indexes. The hypothetical indexes are only considered during query planning, not execution.
