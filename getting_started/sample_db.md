# Sample Database for Testing

In this project, we will utilize a sample database that is carefully sized to balance performance impact and manageability. The database is large enough to demonstrate the impact of our tests on performance, providing meaningful insights and results. However, it is not so large as to become unwieldy or difficult to handle, ensuring that our tests remain efficient and practical. This approach allows us to effectively assess and optimize database operations without unnecessary complexity.

### IMDB
This is a dump generated by pg_dump -Fc of the IMDb data used in the "How Good are Query Optimizers, Really?" paper. PostgreSQL compatible SQL queries and scripts to automatically create a VM with this dataset can be found here: https://git.io/imdb (2019-09-24). The dump is 1.2GB. https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2QYZBT
