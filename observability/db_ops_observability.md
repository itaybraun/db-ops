# DB Observability
Monitoring database activity is crucial to ensure smooth operations and prevent issues. Without proper monitoring, you may be unaware of problems until it's too late. You would like tot know what went wrong and why:
1. Lack of monitoring left you blind to warning signs
2. Unexpected data growth exceeded database capacity
3. Resource contention impacted performance
4. Inefficient queries slowed execution
5. Application errors related to the DB
