# DB Schema Tools
- Visualize the Schema.
- Compare the structure of two schemas (one DB vs another or one DB vs a previous version of the schema of the same DB).

## Schema Visualization Tools
**Azimutt**
- URL: https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt
- Desc: Next-Gen ERD: Design, Explore, Document and Analyze your database, schema and data. Azimutt is a full-stack database exploration tool, from modern ERD made for real world databases (big & messy), to fast data navigation, but also documentation everywhere and whole database analysis.

## Schema Compare Tools
**pg-schema-diff**
- URL: https://github.com/stripe/pg-schema-diff
- Desc: Computes the diff(erences) between Postgres database schemas and generates the SQL required to get your database schema from point A to B with minimal downtime & locks. This enables you to take your database and migrate it to any desired schema defined in plain DDL. The tooling attempts to use native postgres migration operations to perform online migrations and avoid locking wherever possible. Not all migrations will be lock-free and some might require downtime, but the hazards system will warn you ahead of time when that's the case. Stateful online migration techniques, like shadow tables, aren't yet supported.
